# Speech-Recognition-System
Here's a basic Speech Recognition System built using Python and libraries like SpeechRecognition and pydub for handling audio, and optionally Wav2Vec2 from HuggingFace for deep learning-based transcription.

## Overview
This project implements a basic speech-to-text system using Python. It supports:
- Google Web Speech API via `SpeechRecognition`
- Facebookâ€™s Wav2Vec2 model via HuggingFace for deep learning transcription

### Run with SpeechRecognition:
```bash
python main.py
